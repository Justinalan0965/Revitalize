# Revitalize
This project focuses on restoring damaged or old images and converting grayscale images into vivid colorized versions. It leverages deep learning models to bring new life to photos by enhancing their quality and appearance. The project is currently under debugging but is being pushed to GitHub for tracking and documentation purposes.

##Project Overview

The goal of this project is to restore images that have degraded over time or have been damaged. In addition to restoration, the project colorizes grayscale images to make them visually appealing. By using state-of-the-art models, it performs tasks like scratch removal, artifact correction, and colorization effectively.

###Key Features

-Image Restoration: Fixing scratches, improving resolution, and enhancing image details.
-Image Colorization: Adding natural colors to black-and-white or faded images.

##Technologies Used

*<b>GFP-GAN:</b>This model was created by the team at Tencent ARC Lab. It uses facial priors and generative models to enhance the quality of images, especially for facial restorations. You can learn more about it <a href='https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN'>here</a>.
*<b>DeOldify:</b> Developed by Jason Antic, DeOldify is a deep learning-based model designed for image colorization. It uses GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and other AI techniques to colorize images in a realistic manner. You can explore the project <a href='https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify'>here.</a>

##Current Status

*<b>Under Debugging:</b> The project is still in the debugging phase, and certain features may not work as expected. This repository will serve as a development log while I continue to refine the models and optimize the system.
